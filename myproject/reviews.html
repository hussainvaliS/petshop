            Since the time I got a pet , HUFT is my go to for all his essentials.
            It‚Äôs the best place for pet shopping . Their staff is extremely good and knowledgeable.
            They take care of our pets well. My pet turned 4years recently and they pampered him with a calming massage,
            cape and some goodies. They are the best in town</p>

            Interesting store. Pet lovers will love this place. Located in a busy area with a parking facility, Spa,
            toys and you get everything your pet needs. Sofa beds are really good and available in all sizes.

            It has been our goto destination for the last 9 years. The products and collection is amazing. But to top it
            off, I think the staff here are exceptional. The personal touch makes us come 30kms to Lavelle Road.
            Everyone in the shop is more like a family for Jazz n Ruby and they love coming here.
            Kudos to them for making the spa experience out of the world.
            Thank you for the brilliant work!!!</p>
